 Japan Travel Blog from 2016 & 2019

Thank you for taking a look at my project for Code Louisville's Front End course. This site is intended to be 
a travel site that compiles data, pictures, and videos from my two trips to Japan in 2016 and 2019.

This site has the following elements:
1. A media query that shows change from Mobile (single column format) to larger formats (double column).
2. A media query that sets the maximum px for both tablets & desktops to ensure that the double column format does not bleed off the page.
3. At a minimum, eight commits to Github.
4. A navigation menu that expands and collapses through the hambuger icon. It is in a fixed position to the top so it is always shown as the user scrolls in mobile or desktop versions.
5. A flexbox that changes from single to double column format.
6. A Javascript function that hides & shows content on the page (the columns of text).

Future updates would include a photo gallery with clickable images that can expand and then scale down when clicked again.
